So, we just finished getting new grad students for our lab, and I'm ecstatic! One thing I keep noting though is what folks tell incoming grads to focus on versus what will actually let them thrive. This is one of the few times in your life where youâ€™ll really get to pick your own supervisor at a job, so you should pick what will support you through the process, rather than look good on your CV. I'm gonna piss off some folk right off the bat with this. For the majority of grad students, the research and prestige of the lab isn't what matters. Now, if you wanna go be a tenured faculty at an ivy league institute, the prestige does absolutely matter. There's plenty of research that shows the incestuous hiring practices of ivy league institutes. However! Most grad students don't go to grad school planning to go be a tenured professor at XYZ ivy league institute. So it doesn't matter!

For the research, there's a lot of arguments about making sure the research lines up with your interests, which is true and valid. However! There's a lot of wiggle room in research, so as long as they're broadly in the same area, you'll probably be fine. Again, most grad students come in going "I think something in this broad space would be cool" or "I have never done this specific thing, but I am absolutely in love with this specific thing and must do precisely this." For both of these groups, broad alignment verse narrow focus is healthy. If you're in the camp of "I've been doing research on this specific topic, and have the means and approval to keep digging in here" then yeah, picking based on who will best support that continuing project makes sense. For anyone else? Nah, don't stress it.

Okay, we don't care about prestige or specific research nuance, what should we care about? I'm glad you asked! I have a list!

1. Department support
2. University support
3. Lab culture
4. Mentoring/Supervision style alignment

Yep, none of those are at all related to research, and 95% of that involves talking to not the potential advisor. So, let's go through each one of these.

## Department Support
You will, by and large, run into hurdles either with your advisor, or that your advisor cannot handle. The big ones are either that your advisor leaves the university, or is just a bad match for you. For both of these scenarios, sometimes they just appear out of nowhere, but the big thing is: how does the department at large handle these issues? Will they help you find another advisor to keep your research and degree on track? If you're having issues with your advisor, will the department support you in changing advisors in a way that does not negatively impact your carreer? AKA, do they handle the politics so your previous advisor doesn't badmouth you? Basically, checking how the department handles these situations is ultimately how you protect yourself from the major horror stories of advisor abuses. "But this could never happen to me! I picked my advisor so carefully!" That doesn't matter. It could still happen! Or, you could have a serious miscommunication, where you need a third party to correct the situation to get your advisor relationship back on track. In any of these situations, being in a department that is willing, able, and does step in to support grad students in handling these situations is incredibly important for the sake of your sanity and mental wellbeing. You are not an island, and propr department support can mitigate feeling like one.

## University Support
Isn't this the same as departmental support? No! This is things like mental health support, and having outside groups that will actually step in to protect you if something happens. What do I mean? Imagine you get a concussion and can't do math for a couple months. All your classes and research are math, so you just... can't do them while you recover. You need to take an incomplete on assignment, etc. Some faculty get it. Others don't. What if your advisor doesn't want to fund you while you can't do the research? University level protections and groups step in to make sure you aren't fucked. In the funding scenario, having a graduate employee union is phenomenal, because they have contract negotiations and bargaining to protect you in these situations, and provide different levels of support with types of leaves of absences. They also help make sure you get benefits like health insurance. This might matter less if you're still under your parents health insurance, but it can still be incredibly helpful.

## Lab Culture
This one you've probably heard before. "Talk to the grad students! See what they think of the lab!" That's all well and good, but what are you actually trying to find out by talking to them? A lot of things. How does the advisor handle if stuff doesn't get done on time? How understanding are they of family emergencies? How often do you get to see the advisor? Do they let you take ownership or really push for things to go specifically how they want it? How do they give feedback? Do they give feedback? Does the lab as a whole support each other? Do they hang out at all? How much project overlap is there between the students? What's skill or expectation onboarding look like? Do they keep a list of lab resources? It's much less "is everyone friendly?" and much more, what is the lab like day-to-day? What kind of supports are there and how do they interact. And THEN on the social front: do they expect you to engage in all of their socials? What kind of socials are they? Are they a drinking lab? Do they expect you to go get black out drunk with them on friday nights? Do they expect you to be in the lab suffering with them 12 hours a day 7 days a week?

## Supervision Style
Finally, some of the questions from lab culture bleed over here. You ask about them with the grad students, and ask about them from the advisor. Take note of what the advisor says in response, and how they conduct themselves. Do they show up late, if you ask about their average graduation rate, do they push it off as entirely based on "the drive of the graduate students" (big red flag)?
